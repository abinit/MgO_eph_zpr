This repository hosts precomputed files for the tutorial on ZPR and temperature-dependent band gaps.

To regenerate the files, make sure AbiPy and Abinit are installed and properly configured. 
Then execute:

    ./run_zpr_mgo.py -s

Finally, execute `rmfiles.py` to remove the files that should not be added to the repo.
